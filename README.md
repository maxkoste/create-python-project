# Create Python Project Script

This script helps automate the creation of new Python projects on macOS. It sets up the basic structure of a Python project.

## Features

- Sets up a basic Python project structure.
- Creates virtual environments (optional).

## Usage

### 1. **Place the Script in a Directory in Your PATH**

To run the `create_py` script from anywhere on your system, you need to place it in a directory thatâ€™s in your `PATH`.

- You can move the `create_py` script to any directory that is already in your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin/` or `$HOME/bin/`.

Alternatively, you can create a new directory for your custom scripts and add it to your `PATH`. For example:

1. Create a new directory for your scripts:
   ```
   mkdir -p $HOME/create-python-project
   ```
2.	Move the create_py script to that directory:
    ```
    mv /usr/local/bin/create_py $HOME/create-python-project/create_py
    ```
3.	Update your PATH by adding the following line to your ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bash_profile if you use bash):
   ```
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/create-python-project
   ```
4.	After updating your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile, you need to reload it:
   ```
   source ~/.zshrc  # for Zsh users
   source ~/.bash_profile  # for Bash users
   ```   
### 2. **Run the script**
Once the script is added to your PATH, open a terminal and run the following command to create a new Python project:
  ```
  create_py
  ```
